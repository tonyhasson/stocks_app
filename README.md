# stocks_app
I made these python programs for my own use.

stocks.py-I can use this program to create a new stocks portfolio,see a pie graph and a linear graph of my portfolio,edit my portfolio and register to the automatic stock data updater.




stock_automated_data.py-this program updates automaticly the stock prices in the portfolios of user that are signed to the program and adds a screenshot of todays portfolio to 
the user's private folder.



scrap_all_stocks.py-used for a diffrent app that i'm building,this program is scraping the data of all the stock exchanges that I choose in advance.
